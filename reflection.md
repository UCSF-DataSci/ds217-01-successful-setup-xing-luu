# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
I'm a pediatric endocrinology fellow taking the advanced training in clinical research certificate course.  I majored in bioengineering in undergraduate, then went straight into medical school, residency, and now fellowship. Most of my time outside of class is spent in patient care--in the clinic and hospital. My research is currently in type 1 diabetes and diabetes technologies and cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes. In my free time, I love hanging out with my dog--A pembroke welsh corgi.  

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
  I took one course in Matlab in college but I'm hoping to get experience with python programming. The type of thinking and logic is very different from my day to day so it seems foreign and challenging, but I think that can be fun! There are many applications of AI that can be applied in my field--perhaps decision support tools, risk prediction for diabetes progression, AI to help with diabetes management tasks, the ideas are plenty! I hope to potentially delve into all of this, but first start learning the basics of how to use Python. 

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I'd love to learn how AI and data science can be incorporated into clinical medicine--perhaps in my own practice and help me on my day to day with patient care, and in research!  

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
