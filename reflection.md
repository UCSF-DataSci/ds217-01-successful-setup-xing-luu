# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
I'm a pediatric endocrinology fellow taking the advanced training in clinical research certificate course.  I majored in bioengineering in undergraduate, then went straight into medical school, residency, fellowship. Most of my time outside of class is spent in patient care--in the clinic and hospital. Otherwise I love hanging out with my dog--A pembroke welsh corgi.  

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
  I took one course in Matlab in college but I'm hoping to get some basics of programming. The type of thinking and logic is very different from my day to day so it seems foreign and challenging, but I think that can be fun! 

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I'd love to learn how AI and data science can be incorporated into clinical medicine--perhaps in my own practice and help me on my day to day with patient care, and in research! There's so much potential
